      <h2>BassCenter 2017</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="bcx" align='center'>
      <p>BassCenter 2017, also known as BCX, was the tenth anniversary of Bassnectar's craziest extravaganza. This year the event was held within the Hampton Colesium, located in Hampton, Virginia. To me, this was a big part of why this event was so special
        me. Bassnectar, in collaboration with an artist named Pretty Lights, held an event inside of the Colesium dubbed "BassLights", which came to an unfortunate end in 2015. Being back inside of this wonderous building filled my heart with memories
        and joy. Fueled by musical maddness, driven by a musical genius, and accompanied by beautiful people; made for my favorite drive down Bassnectar lane!</p>

      <h2>Atlanta Secret Shows</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="atl" align='center'>
      <p>In September of 2016, Bassnectar hosted a secret location event in Downtown Atlanta. Themed as an old-school warehouse rave, with minimal focus on technical production, the Bassnectar team whipped up an event that will go down in history. It is
        challenging now-adays to curate an event that feels like it is in the 90's, but they sure did. Between the atmosphere, layout, and production style, I personally felt incredibly connected to the crowd and energy. It felt like we were all one unit,
        functioning as one massive wave.</p>

      <h2>Freestyle Sessions</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="free" align='center'>
      <p><a href=#video>Check out the video above</a> to see a little of what went down! Freestyle Sessions was a unique event for the BN crew, with themes for each night of a three night run. Hosted in Denver, Colorado, we boarded a plane to the holy land!
        Each night came with it's own emotion, making for such a spectacular musical event. Night 1, dubbed Freestlye, was a beautiful intro to the maddness. Night 2, dubbed Dreamtempo, me crying like a little girl. Finally, Night 3, dubbed Wildstyle,
        was an absolute roller coaster ride. Even with some bumps in the road, Freestyle Sessions truly deserves #3 on the list!</p>

      <h2>Atlantic City</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="ac" align='center'>
      <p>Following in the footsteps of the Atlanta Secret Shows, this event was certainly a wonderfully weird experience. First, this needs to be addressed: Atlantic City seems like a messed up dream. Literally. Everything about that town just seemed out
        dated, even the bums. Nonetheless, this weird and wonky atmosphere made for a perfect setting to have 18,000 bassheads take over. Formatted much like the Atlanta shows, the AC shows really took the production into overdrive; while maintaining
        that old-school vibe. Throw some absolutely INSANE music into the mix, and this event breaks into my top five!</p>

    <div id="basslights" align='center'>
      <h2>Basslights 2015</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="bl" align='center'>
      <p>Last, but certainly not least, a throw-back! Bassnectar and Pretty Lights teamed up to double-headline a two night event in the Hampton Colesium, fusing two different styles of music into one crazy event. Unfortunately, the Basslights era came to
        a close in 2015. Now, all we have left from that beautiful series of events are memories of lasers and bass bouncing around in the Mothership. These were my first Nectar special events, so they do hold a special place in my heart, and closing
        out my Top Five list!</p>
