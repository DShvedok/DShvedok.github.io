    <p>
      Lorin Ashton, also known as Bassnectar, was born into a musical family in Southern California. Growing up Lorin was surrounded by music, leading him to hard core rock and eventually into Death Metal. Gathering inspiration from Hip-Hop and his past in
      Death Metal, the man then created a style of music that eventually gathered hundreds of thousands of followers. One of those followers being myself! Let's dive into the world of Bass Music! For more information, click the link above!
    </p>
    <h3>Why Do I Follow Bass Music?</h3>
    <p>I dove into this world at the young age of 14, going to my first show at the age of 15. Quickly, the name "Bassnectar" was thrown around by everyone attending those shows, so naturally, I became curious. From the very first time I heard his music,
      I was hooked. From there, I needed to figure out how I was going to see him live. From then until now, four years have passed and I have witnessed 29 Bassnectar live sets. This genre is more than just music. To many, almost all, this genre is an
      oasis to escape from the real world. To embrace your inner wild side and rage on until the sun comes up. To spread love to anyone who is willing to recieve it. Overall, Bassnectar has changed who I am today, and below are my top five favorite sets!</p>

    <h4>BassCenter 2017</h4>
    <p>BassCenter 2017, also known as BCX, was the tenth anniversary of Bassnectar's craziest extravaganza. This year the event was held within the Hampton Colesium, located in Hampton, Virginia. To me, this was a big part of why this event was so special
      me. Bassnectar, in collaboration with an artist named Pretty Lights, held an event inside of the Colesium dubbed "BassLights", which came to an unfortunate end in 2015. Being back inside of this wonderous building filled my heart with memories and
      joy. Fueled by musical maddness, driven by a musical genius, and accompanied by beautiful people; made for my favorite drive down Bassnectar lane!
      <div class="atlanta" align='center'>
        <h4>Atlanta Secret Shows</h4>
        <p>In September of 2016, Bassnectar hosted a secret location event in Downtown Atlanta. Themed as an old-school warehouse rave, with minimal focus on technical production, the Bassnectar team whipped up an event that will go down in history. It is
          challenging now-adays to curate an event that feels like it is in the 90's, but they sure did. Between the atmosphere, layout, and production style, I personally felt incredibly connected to the crowd and energy. It felt like we were all one
          unit, functioning as one massive wave.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="freestyle" align="center">
        <h4>Freestyle Sessions</h4>
        <p><a href=# "Video">Check out the video above</a> to see a little of what went down! Freestyle Sessions was a unique event for the BN crew, with themes for each night of a three night run. Hosted in Denver, Colorado, we boarded a plane to the holy
          land! Each night came with it's own emotion, making for such a spectacular musical event. Night 1, dubbed Freestlye, was a beautiful intro to the maddness. Night 2, dubbed Dreamtempo, me crying like a little girl. Finally, Night 3, dubbed Wildstyle,
          was an absolute roller coaster ride. Even with some bumps in the road, Freestyle Sessions truly deserves #3 on the list!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ac" align='center'>
        <h4>Atlantic City</h4>
        <p>Following in the footsteps of the Atlanta Secret Shows, this event was certainly a wonderfully weird experience. First, this needs to be addressed: Atlantic City seems like a messed up dream. Literally. Everything about that town just seemed out
          dated, even the bums. Nonetheless, this weird and wonky atmosphere made for a perfect setting to have 18,000 bassheads take over. Formatted much like the Atlanta shows, the AC shows really took the production into overdrive; while maintaining
          that old-school vibe. Throw some absolutely INSANE music into the mix, and this event breaks into my top five!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="basslights" align='center'>
        <h4>Basslights 2015</h4>
        <p>Last, but certainly not least, a throw-back! Bassnectar and Pretty Lights teamed up to double-headline a two night event in the Hampton Colesium, fusing two different styles of music into one crazy event. Unfortunately, the Basslights era came
          to a close in 2015. Now, all we have left from that beautiful series of events are memories of lasers and bass bouncing around in the Mothership. These were my first Nectar special events, so they do hold a special place in my heart, and closing
          out my Top Five list!</p>
